The open guide to Zoom Developer Products
=========================================

This open guide is an unofficial guide to Zoom's Developer Product. The intention of this guide is to provide a code centric and use-case centric approach. This is by no means an exhausive guide, and updates to this guide is best effort. 

This guide will by no means, compare the features and capabilities with other similar providers in the market.
